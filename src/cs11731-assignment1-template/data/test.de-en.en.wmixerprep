you know , one of the intense pleasures of travel and one of the delights of <unk> research is the opportunity to live amongst those who have not forgotten the old ways , who still feel their past in the wind , touch it in stones <unk> by rain , taste it in the bitter leaves of plants .
just to know that jaguar <unk> still journey beyond the milky way , or the myths of the inuit elders still resonate with meaning , or that in the himalaya , the buddhists still pursue the breath of the <unk> , is to really remember the central revelation of anthropology , and that is the idea that the world in which we live does not exist in some absolute sense , but is just one model of reality , the consequence of one particular set of adaptive choices that our lineage made , albeit successfully , many generations ago .
and of course , we all share the same adaptive imperatives .
we &apos;re all born . we all bring our children into the world .
we go through initiation <unk> .
we have to deal with the inexorable separation of death , so it shouldn &apos;t surprise us that we all sing , we all dance , we all have art .
but what &apos;s interesting is the unique cadence of the song , the rhythm of the dance in every culture .
and whether it is the <unk> in the forests of borneo , or the voodoo <unk> in haiti , or the warriors in the <unk> desert of northern kenya , the <unk> in the mountains of the andes , or a <unk> in the middle of the sahara -- this is incidentally the fellow that i traveled into the desert with a month ago -- or indeed a yak herder in the slopes of <unk> , everest , the goddess mother of the world .
all of these peoples teach us that there are other ways of being , other ways of thinking , other ways of <unk> yourself in the earth .
and this is an idea , if you think about it , can only fill you with hope .
now , together the myriad cultures of the world make up a web of spiritual life and cultural life that <unk> the planet , and is as important to the well-being of the planet as indeed is the biological web of life that you know as a biosphere .
and you might think of this cultural web of life as being an <unk> , and you might define the <unk> as being the sum total of all thoughts and dreams , myths , ideas , <unk> , intuitions brought into being by the human imagination since the dawn of consciousness .
the <unk> is humanity &apos;s great legacy .
it &apos;s the symbol of all that we are and all that we can be as an astonishingly <unk> species .
and just as the biosphere has been severely <unk> , so too is the <unk> -- and , if anything , at a far greater rate .
no biologists , for example , would dare suggest that 50 percent of all species or more have been or are on the brink of extinction because it simply is not true , and yet that -- the most apocalyptic scenario in the realm of biological diversity -- scarcely approaches what we know to be the most optimistic scenario in the realm of cultural diversity .
and the great indicator of that , of course , is language loss .
when each of you in this room were born , there were 6,000 languages spoken on the planet .
now , a language is not just a body of vocabulary or a set of <unk> rules .
a language is a flash of the human spirit .
it &apos;s a vehicle through which the soul of each particular culture comes into the material world .
every language is an old-growth forest of the mind , a watershed , a thought , an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities .
and of those 6,000 languages , as we sit here today in monterey , fully half are no longer being whispered into the ears of children .
they &apos;re no longer being taught to babies , which means , effectively , unless something changes , they &apos;re already dead .
what could be more lonely than to be enveloped in silence , to be the last of your people to speak your language , to have no way to pass on the wisdom of the ancestors or anticipate the promise of the children ?
and yet , that dreadful fate is indeed the plight of somebody somewhere on earth roughly every two weeks , because every two weeks , some elder dies and carries with him into the grave the last <unk> of an ancient tongue .
and i know there &apos;s some of you who say , &quot; well , wouldn &apos;t it be better , wouldn &apos;t the world be a better place if we all just spoke one language ? &quot; and i say , &quot; great , let &apos;s make that language yoruba . let &apos;s make it <unk> .
let &apos;s make it <unk> . &quot;
and you &apos;ll suddenly discover what it would be like to be unable to speak your own language .
and so , what i &apos;d like to do with you today is sort of take you on a journey through the <unk> , a brief journey through the <unk> , to try to begin to give you a sense of what in fact is being lost .
now , there are many of us who sort of forget that when i say &quot; different ways of being , &quot; i really do mean different ways of being .
take , for example , this child of a <unk> in the northwest amazon , the people of the <unk> who believe that <unk> they came up the milk river from the east in the belly of sacred snakes .
now , this is a people who cognitively do not distinguish the color blue from the color green because the canopy of the heavens is <unk> to the canopy of the forest upon which the people depend .
they have a curious language and marriage rule which is called &quot; linguistic <unk> : &quot; you must marry someone who speaks a different language .
and this is all rooted in the mythological past , yet the curious thing is in these long houses , where there are six or seven languages spoken because of <unk> , you never hear anyone practicing a language .
they simply listen and then begin to speak .
or , one of the most fascinating tribes i ever lived with , the <unk> of northeastern ecuador , an astonishing people first contacted peacefully in 1958 .
in 1957 , five <unk> attempted contact and made a critical mistake .
they dropped from the air 8 x 10 <unk> photographs of themselves in what we would say to be friendly gestures , forgetting that these people of the rainforest had never seen anything two-dimensional in their lives .
they picked up these photographs from the forest floor , tried to look behind the face to find the form or the figure , found nothing , and concluded that these were calling cards from the devil , so they <unk> the five <unk> to death .
but the <unk> didn &apos;t just spear outsiders .
they <unk> each other .
54 percent of their mortality was due to them <unk> each other .
we traced <unk> back eight generations , and we found two instances of natural death and when we <unk> the people a little bit about it , they admitted that one of the fellows had gotten so old that he died getting old , so we <unk> him anyway .
but at the same time they had a <unk> knowledge of the forest that was astonishing .
their hunters could smell animal urine at 40 paces and tell you what species left it behind .
in the early &apos; 80s , i had a really astonishing assignment when i was asked by my professor at harvard if i was interested in going down to haiti , <unk> the secret societies which were the foundation of <unk> &apos;s strength and <unk> <unk> , and securing the poison used to make <unk> .
in order to make sense out of sensation , of course , i had to understand something about this remarkable faith of <unk> . and voodoo is not a black magic cult .
on the contrary , it &apos;s a complex metaphysical worldview .
it &apos;s interesting .
